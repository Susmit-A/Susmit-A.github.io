				Hey guys! I am an engineering student currently in my second year. I am pursuing by B.E. degree in Computer Sceince and Engineering at SMVIT college, Bangalore, India.
			</p>
			<p>
				Coding is not just something I have to do, it is my passion. I know how to code in C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Perl. Apart from these, I know x86 assembly. I can also write shell scripts for Linux.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of my favourite hobbies is android app development. I am well versed with Android's internal architecture and have 	even developed some custom firmwares myself. I also make apps as a freelancer.
			</p>
			<p>
				My other hobbies include playing the Guitar and Drums. I also enjoy reading and watching movies. Big Marvel fan, BTW.
